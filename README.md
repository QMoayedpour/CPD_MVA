Project on the paper Detecting Changes in Slope With an L0 Penalty (Maidstone et al. 2017) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.01672

``report.pdf`` contains the final report, some details about the algorithm and how to make it. The main class is CPOP, that take the serie y, beta and sigma as an imput and return the detected changepoints with .run().
